# my selection criteria

1. Firstly, I primarily search for electronic literature from the "[Electronic Literature Collection](https://collection.eliterature.org/) and [The NEXT](https://the-next.eliterature.org/), because their introductions are more detailed and clearer.

3. Thirdly, the web link can be opened. Because sometimes, there is some electronic literatures are inaccessible.
4. Lastly, I strive to find diverse electronic literature as much as possible, including comics, interactive fiction, digital poetry, etc.

# my data model 
My data model has 16 columns, it includes the electronic literature's bibliographic information and digital-specific characteristics. for example, the title, author, type, technology, interaction_level, preservation_status and license, etc.
Because they are born-digital literary works, texts that depend on the capabilities and context of a computer (stand-alone or network). Sometimes we may face data loss, and a version change condition, we need to record more detailed information relevant to the digital.

 sometimes we need to install some plugs, then the works start to work.
 ## era
 some older version eletronic literature can not work in this new computer system.
 ## discoverability
