## Part B: Case study 
### B1. Object description (digital literary object)

My digital literary object is 《))breathe((》, it is a hypermedia poem with a minimalist interface that captures a moment in time.  
It has two creator: Knoebel David and Strasser Reiner. They use HTML computer language edit it and we can use this link accessed: http://www.workxspace.de/valentine/val_va/. The accessibility way is graphical navigation and it depends on web browser.   
This item’s text part is the poem content, but it also has voice, graph, and interactive part. When we click different color figures, it will give us different poem sentence.

### B2. Textual model & medium

Regarding its textual model, it is linear. When we enter the website, follow the colour figure clicking, and the poems also appear in sequence.  
The colourful interface with a beautiful poem, it makes the reader feel interested and evokes a good emotion.

### B3. Narratology
This work does not follow a traditional narrative structure.   
There is no clear narrator or sequence of events.   
Rather than telling a story, the piece functions as a short digital poem focused on language and interaction.  
Narrative time is absent: the text does not develop through a chronological order but exists as a momentary.  
Focalization is the reader, who occupies the central position, as meaning emerges through their interaction with the interface.  
This poem consists of only nine lines and lacks clear segmentation. It appears to emphasize a romantic atmosphere.

### B5. Reflection
As a digital poem, its operation on the website emphasizes interactivity, with each line corresponding to a distinct color, enhancing the reading experience.  
However, it does not support close reading; verses can only be displayed by clicking with the mouse, making textual analysis inconvenient.  
If printed, it loses its original sound and color, and this interactive quality with the poem disappears as well.
